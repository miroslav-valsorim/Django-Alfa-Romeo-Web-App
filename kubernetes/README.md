Version 1 of running my application in single Kubernetes cluster, all files and steps provided. Still a lot of things to clear out. Everything with the website works as expected, some features are not working due to the fact few env miss like smtp mail and etc. (while registering will throw error 500, but you will still be registered.)

For this setup you need:
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Minikube
- kubectl
